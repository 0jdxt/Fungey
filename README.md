# Fungey
Befunge-93/98 interpreter written in Python.

*98 is only partially supported. Check [instructions.py](https://github.com/0jdxt/Fungey/blob/6842928c16b1599f43c6b35bbe958a20909f5217/instructions.py#L150) for available commands.*

***

### Usage

`cd` into the root directory.

```bash
$ ./interpreter.py PROGRAM [--raw]
```

where `PROGRAM` is the path to a Befunge source file.

#### Output
The interpeter outputs a newline after the program output if stdout is to the terminal (`sys.stdout.isatty()` is `True`). To keep raw output in the terminal, use the `--raw` flag. Piping and redirecting uses the raw output automatically.

#### Input
Input to a Befunge program can be piped from stdin like so:

```bash
$ echo "5" | ./interpreter.py programs/factorial.b93
```

otherwise input will be prompted for like normal:

* `=>` input line (waits for line feed)
*  `>` input character (waits for single character)
